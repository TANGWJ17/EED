# Toolkit for EED (encomonic-environmental dispatch) problems

This is a toolkit for solving optimization problems of EED. In EED, power output of each generators are required to minimize both of the cost and greenhouse or harmful gas emission. Only thermal generators and DC power flow are considered at present and take into account alternating current power flow, wind, solar, hydro and other renewable generators in the future. The problem is solved by DE (differential evolution) algorithm.

GUI is also provided which facilitates usage. 



# Requirements

This toolkit and platform is based on python 3.7. It requires the following Python packages: (i) Numpy, (ii) Matplotlib (for plotting), (iii) PyQt5 (for GUI).
